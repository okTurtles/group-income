# Troubleshooting

## Miscellaneous

Make sure:

- You have at least Node version 8 installed
- You're visiting: http://localhost:8000 and **NOT** http://localhost:3000
- You've [followed the setup instructions](Getting-Started-frontend.md#how-do-i-get-set-up--just-run-the-site)

Try:

- `npm cache clean` - This fixed a real problem someone was having
- `npm install npm@latest -g`
