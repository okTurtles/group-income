# Documentation

This folder contains a lot of human-generated documenation in the `src/` folder, especially:

- A [style guide](./src/Style-Guide.md) for developers to follow before submitting PRs
- The [information flow](./src/Information-Flow.md)
- And [login flow](./src/LOGIN_FLOW.md)

It's intended to be used with `mdbook`, but for some reason the automatic book deployments stuff is broken. You can just read the docs here on GitHub.

You're also encouraged to read [this AI-generated Wiki](https://deepwiki.com/okTurtles/group-income) as it contains much more in-depth information about the project, although it might not be 100% accurate, it is still worth reviewing.
