/* REVIVEW PR
  the whole "state" being passed as argument to rules[rule]() is overwhelmed.
  It would be simpler with just 2 simple args: "threshold" and "population".
  Advantages:
  - population: No need to do the logic to get it (and avoid import PROFILE_STATUS.ACTIVE from group.js).
  - threshold: The selector to get the selector is huge.
  - tests: Avoid the need to mock a complex state.
  My suggestion: 1 parameter (object) with 4 explicit keys.
