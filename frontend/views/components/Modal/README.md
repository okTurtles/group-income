# Modal System

We have a centralized modal architecture. In other words, We only have 1 main dynamic modal that changes its content based on the current open modal by using `:is` Vue feature.

Then we can easily open/close any modal from anywhere in the app using `sbp()`.

Let's see a real example working: **the Login modal**:

### The Modal content
Each modal should be composed by the following components so we keep consistence in the spacers and text across the different modals.

- `<modal-header>`
- `<modal-body>`
- `<modal-footer>`

You can check how Login is done at `containers/LoginModal.vue`.

### How to open a modal

From anywhere in the App we can open any modal by using the `sbp` event `OPEN_MODAL` with the Vue Component that contains the modal Content

```html
<!-- NavBar.vue -->
<template>
  <button @click="openLoginModal">Sign up</button>
</template>

<script>
import LoginModal from './LoginModal.vue'
import sbp from '../../../../shared/sbp.js'
import { OPEN_MODAL } from '../../utils/events.js'

openLoginModal () {
  sbp('okTurtles.events/emit', OPEN_MODAL, LoginModal)
}
</script>
```

### How to close a modal
In the same way we can also close the modal by using the event `CLOSE_MODAL`:

```js
// LoginModal.vue

closeModal () {
  sbp('okTurtles.events/emit', CLOSE_MODAL)
}
```

### The `<modal-dynamic />`

The `<modal-dynamic />` is imported at `simple/index.html` at the bottom of the DOM.

Its only responsability is to import `<modal-basic />`, add its content as a dynamic component [(Know more about Vue Dynamic Components)](https://vuejs.org/v2/api/#is) and listen for `sbp` events `OPEN_MODAL` and `CLOSE_MODAL`.
