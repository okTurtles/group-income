## SVG Sprites

### What it is
SVGs are generated into a single SVG sprite.
The main advantage of this approach is we are able to modify directly each SVG property (ex: fill) to adapt correctly to each theme.

### How it works
Do not modify `sprite.svg` directly. The file is generated by Grunt using the plugin [grunt-svg-sprite](https://www.npmjs.com/package/grunt-svg-sprite).
