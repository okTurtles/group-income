/* Some Notes / Best Practices about writing Cypress tests:
- After performing an action that changes the view, look for ways to assert it
  before looking for the new element that migh not exist yet.
  For ex:, check the new URL. A common action at GI is to close the modal.
  Use cy.closeModal() - it closes and waits for the modal to be closed
  (URL changed) before moving on...
- ...
