3. Clone this repo (or a fork of it if you plan on [contributing](#contributing)) and `cd` into it.
4. Install dependencies: `npm install`
5. Now try out the [dev workflow](#basic-workflow).
- üë©‚Äçüé® Check out how Group Income will feel like by taking a look at the [design files on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/mxGadAHfkWH6qApebQvcdN/Group-Income-2.0?node-id=1204%3A0)

#### Basic workflow

To get started with development, follow the steps in **[Getting Started](#getting-started)** first.

Run all servers + watch files for changes

```bash
grunt dev
```

- If all went well you should be able to visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

Create a tunnel to share access over the Internet:

```
grunt dev --tunnel
```

Build the app for distribution

```bash
grunt dist
```

Clean up files in `dist/`

```bash
grunt clean
```

Run tests.

**NOTE: You may need to first install Cypress using `./node_modules/.bin/cypress install`**

```bash
# all tests
grunt test

# all tests while skipping build step
grunt test --skipbuild

# unit tests only (always skips build)
grunt test:unit

# show e2e tests (Cypress) live in a browser
grunt test --browser

# run e2e tests (Cypress) in "open" mode
grunt test --browser=debug

# Developing at the same time as writing E2E tests
grunt dev
# and in another terminal run Cypress in "open" mode
npm run cy:open
```

#### Using Docker for extra security

You can run commands in a Docker container by using `npm run docker -- <cmd>` instead.

For example:

```bash
npm run docker -- npm install
npm run docker -- grunt dev
npm run docker -- grunt test --skipbuild
```

For details, see: **[`Docker.md`](docs/Docker.md)**

## Troubleshooting

If you run into any errors [during the setup](docs/Getting-Started-frontend.md#how-do-i-get-set-up--just-run-the-site), try the suggestions in [`Troubleshooting.md`](docs/Troubleshooting.md).
