[Group Income](https://groupincome.org/) is a fair income sharing mechanism that allows groups to provide their members a minimum income.

This semi-centralized "Simple Edition" of Group Income is our way to rapidly prototype, develop, and research the concept with real groups.

## Installation

1. If you haven't already, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) (version 6 or greater).
2. Install [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).
3. Install [`grunt-cli`](https://github.com/gruntjs/grunt-cli) globally (since it's a global tool, you can use either NPM or Yarn).
4. Clone this repo (or a fork of it if you plan on contributing) and `cd` into it.

Finally, run the commands below to [configure yarn](https://github.com/yarnpkg/yarn/issues/1088#issuecomment-263170516) to always install precise versions, and then install the project dependencies:

```
yarn config set save-prefix ''
yarn install
```

grunt clean
```

Run the tests:

```
grunt test
```
