  // This needs to be called from the context that owns this external state
  // (e.g., the tab in which the app is running) and because 'full' Chelonia may
  // be available in this context, we cannot use `chelonia/configure`.
  // _If there is no external state to be kept in sync with Chelonia, this selector doesn't need to be called_
  //
  // For example, **if Chelonia is running on a service worker**, the following
  // would be done.
  // 1. The service worker calls `chelonia/configure` and forwards EVENT_HANDLED
  //    and CONTRACTS_MODIFIED events to all clients (tabs)
  //    Note: `chelonia/configure` is called by the context running Chelonia
  // 2. Each tab uses `chelonia/*` to forward calls to Chelonia to the SW.
  //    Note: Except selectors defined in this file
  // 3. Each tab calls this selector once to set up event listeners on EVENT_HANDLED
  //    and CONTRACTS_MODIFIED, which will keep each tab's state updated every
  //    time Chelonia handles an event.
