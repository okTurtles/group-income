export const minimumCharacters = ''


"Minimum of 7 characters" change to "Your password must be at least 7 characters long."
"cannot contain spaces" change to "A username cannot contain spaces."
"not an e-mail" change to "Please enter a valid email."
"required" change to "A username is required."
"e-mail required" change to "An email is required."
"name is unavailable" change to "This username is already being used."
I can create more than one account with the same email. Shouldn't we have a validation here as well? @taoeffect I know this is not in the scope of this PR, so feel free to do it in another one.

The "Invalid username or password" error should be turned into a banner error. I will add this case to Figma;
"cannot contain spaces" change to "A username cannot contain spaces."
"Minimum of 7 characters" change to "Your password must be at least 7 characters long.";
