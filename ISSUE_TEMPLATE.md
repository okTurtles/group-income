### Instructions

All issues, except `documentation` tagged issues, must be in problem-solution format.

- **Bad:** _"Problem: we need feature X. Solution: make it."_
- **Better:** _"Problem: user cannot do common tasks A or B except by using a complex workaround. Solution: make feature X."_

Per [C4.1](https://rfc.zeromq.org/spec:42/C4/), "seek consensus on the accuracy of your observation, and the value of solving the problem. Do not submit feature requests, ideas, suggestions, or any solutions to problems that are not explicitly documented and provable."

Before submitting, search for existing issues and read [`Troubleshooting.md`](docs/Troubleshooting.md).
